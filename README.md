## FAQ

### When is the Next Update?

We don't know when the next update will be, however you can keep track of development in b78xh-updates and dev-screenshots.

### How do I join the team?

Applications for developers are available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflPA5f4-qopkpgG_MAc46ooBJGWygljyPTCBlr2COsOK6G3w/viewform)

### Is it payware?
No, it is completely free and open-source. However, you must own the Premium Deluxe DLC for Microsoft Flight Simulator to use the modification.

### Where do we report bugs?
Report bugs using the github [issues](https://github.com/Heavy-Division/B78XH/issues/new/choose) tab.

### Where is the plane in-sim?
The B78XH is a modification of the default premium deluxe aircraft, it will not appear as separate from the default.
You need to own the premium deluxe version of MSFS to use the Heavy Division Mod.

### Is this "study-level" ?
While we are dedicated to bringing the most accurate 787 simulation to the platform, "study-level" would not be an
appropriate term, as it connotes FAA certification and licensing which we do not have the resources for.

### Will [X] be implemented in the future?
The general rule of thumb is if it's in the real aircraft, it will be implemented with ours with some limitations until further notice due to copyright (3D model changes).
